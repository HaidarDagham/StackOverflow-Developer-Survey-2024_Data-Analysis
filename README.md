üìå Introduction

Stack Overflow, the go-to platform for developers, conducted a global survey to capture insights into the developer community. This survey includes various questions related to professional experience, coding activities, tools, technologies, and preferences. The dataset offers important information about the current state of software development worldwide.

In this lab, we will work with a subset of the original dataset to explore, analyze, and visualize various trends. The survey data consists of responses from developers with different professional backgrounds, educational levels and geographic locations.
